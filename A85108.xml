         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">I. <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas the Lands of a Copyholder, who is a Tenant at Will, according to Cuſtom, are not ſubject to extent in his life time, nor lyable to his Debts in the hands of his Heirs. It were convenient that ſome Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Act were made for Redreſs hereof; ſecuring the Lords fine, and preſerving the Cuſtom of the Mannor.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That Leaſes taken for other mens lives, whether in Poſſeſſion of the general or ſpecial Occupant, may be ſujected to payment of debts; the Creditor whoſe money bought the Leaſe, or preſerved it from ſale, hath better right thereto, then either of theſe Occupants. Such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects as theſe protect Heirs in Burrough Engliſh; alſo when Lands fall to the yongeſt ſon of a Copyholder; neither of theſe can be charged upon Anceſtors Bonds, becauſe not Heir-general at Common Law.</p>
            <p n="3">III. That an Heir of Tenant in Tail, may be lyable to his Fathers Debts.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That ſome remedy be uſed for payment of Debts, where Parents purchaſe Lands in their Childrens names, with other mens moneys.</p>
            <p n="5">V. That where Heirs-alien Lands before Action brought by the Creditor, they may pay ſuch Debts, and not leave the Creditor to a ſute in Chancery in ſuch plain Caſes.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. That the Creditor for ſecuring his Debt, have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to charge the Heir, and Executor both together, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is uncertain which is beſt able to pay; if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover of one, the other may ſtay his ſute.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:166585:3"/>
            <p n="7">VII. That yonger Brothers, and Grand-children en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying Lands upon diſſent, be lyable to pay Debts.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. That Coheirs in Gavelkinde, where Brethren inherit equally, may all as well as the eldeſt, be lyable to pay Debts; alſo that Lands left in truſt for Children, be lyable to payment of Debts.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. That Creditors have liberty to extend more then half the Debtors Lands for payment of Debts, which cannot be done at preſent.</p>
            <p n="10">X. Whereas rich Debtors get their Lands extended by one Creditor or other, thereby to defraud the reſt; therefore, that as Leaſes, Goods, and Bankrupt Lands are ſold, ſo where the Landed Debtor will not ſell within convenient time; that the Creditors ſhould have the Debtors Lands to ſell and diſpoſe of returning the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus to the Debtor, or elſe that ſome other convenient remedy be uſed herein.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. That there were ſome place in every ſhire for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtering all Leaſes, Bargains, Conveyances, Statutes, Judgements, Recognizances, and the like, which any way concern the Lands in that Shire; in former times care hath been uſed for Recording of Bargains, Sales, and Statutes, within ſix moneths, but none at all for Leaſes, Feeoffments, Deeds of Covenants to ſtand ſeized to Uſes, with Leaſes and Releaſes after them.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. That Writs to take a Debtor dirregible, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to one, and generally to all other Sheriffs or Juſtices within <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">XIII. That the Priviledges and Abuſes of Palatines, which extreamly hinder Payment of Debts, be laid by with us, as they are in <hi>Portugal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="14">XIV. That in regard Attachments prevent Arreſts and Bloodſhed, they may be uſed as well in other parts of <hi>England,</hi> as at <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:166585:4"/>
            <p n="15">XV. That as was uſed by the Antients againſt San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary-men, ſo inſtead of Appearances, notice by Juſtices of the Peace, or the like, may be given or left; and in caſe of Contumacy the ſecond or third time, Proceſs may be made againſt the Offender. This would prevent thoſe Grievances by Outlawry, alſo the great Expences in <hi>Chancery,</hi> the Abuſes in <hi>Palatinates</hi> priviledge, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change and Fairs from Arreſts avoided, Tryals by <hi>Ejectione firmae,</hi> and Abuſes by under Sheriffs.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. To prevent the Abuſes practiced in Wills and Adminiſtrations; that in every great Town or Hundred ſtanding Commiſſioners ſhould be choſen by the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood (and ſworn before ſome Juſtices) for ſeizing and ſelling of Eſtates, unleſs Executors, or the like, give ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſecurity to ſuch Commiſſioners for the abſolute Payment of all Debts, and that all Debtors be paid alike; this courſe might very much help Orphans, alſo the juſt Payment of Debts and Legacies; likewiſe it were good ſome ſtrict Laws were made againſt imbezzling any part of ſuch Eſtates.</p>
            <p n="17">XVII. That Inſolvent Debtors be freed from impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment, or elſe detained ſome ſhort time at the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors charge, till their cauſe be determined, and that their Eſtates be ſeized for ſatisfaction of Creditors.</p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. To help the Creditor for Matter of Proof, that the Debtor, or what others the Creditor or Judges think fit, may be examined upon Oath, as in caſe of Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. For the incouragement of Merchants, and ſome ſpecial Manufactures, as at <hi>Antwerp</hi> ſome Immunities from Arreſts, at leaſt for ſmall ſums, be conferred on the Profeſſors.</p>
            <p n="20">XX. Whereas Poor Men can ſeldom put in Bail, for want whereof, they ſuffer unheard many moneths im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:166585:4"/>till their day of hearing comes, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by often utterly ruined; therefore for prevention, that the Plaintiff by his own Oath, or of ſome credible per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon allowed by the Judge, declare the truth of the Cauſe; wherein, if he failed the priſoner, giving Authority for his appearance, to be diſmiſſed without Bail, or which is better, that the Judge be authoriſed to determine of Law, Fact, and Equity, to avoide the Formality and Charge of pleading.</p>
            <p n="21">XXI. That no perſon be held to Bail, who hath offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pay without Sute of Law, neither ſhould his perſon be lyable to Execution.</p>
            <p n="22">XXII. Whereas by that barbarous and ſenceleſs Law of Preſſing to death, Rich and Landed men are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to Steal, and Acceſſaries wholly eſcape; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if ſuch maner of Offenders were attainted by verdict, ſuch inconveniences might be prevented.</p>
            <p n="23">XXIII. Whereas by Clergy many times Murders, and notorious Thieves, are but warmed a little in the hand, becauſe they can read; and another for a Sheep, or trifle, is hanged not for his offence, but becauſe he cannot read: Therefore it were requiſit, That this ſenceleſs and barbarous Character, which admits of much knavery and cannot be read by every good and able Schollar, were baniſhed, as well as French, Latine, and Court-hand, eſpecially in ſuch caſes which concern mens lives.</p>
            <p n="24">XXIV. That perſons accuſed for life, be permitted Councel, in regard their fears render them often, both ſpeechleſs and unadviſed; bare accuſations are not ſuch ſufficient condemnations, as to deprive any (though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent) of Councel in ſuch extremity.</p>
            <p n="25">XXV. That there may be but one Statute for one Matter and Repeals made total not in part, ſo that men may know what is inforce, what not, and live under ſuch
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:166585:5"/>Laws, as it is poſſible to know which now they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.</p>
            <p n="26">XXVI. That Reverſioners have free power to diſpoſe of their Eſtates without the Tenants conſent: This would both prevent many <hi>Chancery</hi> Sutes, and ſecure Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers.</p>
            <p n="27">XXVII. That the Statute of <hi>Merton</hi> may be totally repealed, and thereby thoſe Antient Local Cuſtoms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in behalf of the Tenants and Inhabitants.</p>
            <p n="28">XXVIII. That the uncertain Fines of Copyholders may be reduced to a certainty, either of an eaſie yearly Rent, or moderate Fine; alſo that the like might be done in ſervile Tenures and Heriots; this would prevent many <hi>Chancery</hi> Sutes and Oppreſſion by Lords.</p>
            <p n="29">XXIX. That the Suborver, as well as the corrupted witneſs, should be ſtigmatized and diſabled for future Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; alſo, that whoſoever unjuſtly takes away anothers Teſtimony by making him a Party ſhould looſe his Sure, if proved: This is an old <hi>Chancery</hi> trick.</p>
            <p n="30">XXX. That Tryal by Combate may be ſuppreſſed as a Reaſonleſs Law, and unwarrantable by Gods Word.</p>
